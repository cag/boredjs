# Brunch Skeletons

This is a registry of brunch skeletons.

Human-readable version: http://brunch.io/skeletons

## Adding your skeleton

Simply edit `skeletons.json` file and add a new entry like that:

```
{
  "title": "Exim",
  "url": "hellyeahllc/with-exim",
  "technologies": "Babel, ES6, React, Exim",
  "description": "Very useful for Cordova apps. A simple skeleton that uses HTML5 boilerplate, React and Exim framework."
}
```

"URL" means GitHub user and repo. For `github.com/a/b` that would be simply `a/b`.

Add your skeletons to the top of the file, but below official Brunch skeletons.
